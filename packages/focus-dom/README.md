Focus management for the DOM

## Next Steps

* Add examples of borrowing from outside Focus.

### Questions

* How to ensure everything works correctly while window is in background?
* What might need to happen when the element hierarchy rearranges?

### Unknown Behaviors to Consider

* automatic reconciliation
  * might depend on more fine-grained fallback rules
    * i.e. removed borrowers release to lenders instead of fallback
* observability
  * onFocus, onBlur for the FocusRegion?
    * alternately, at the root Focus container
* iframes in focus
  * focus fallback out of an iframe
  * focus falling into an iframe
