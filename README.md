Hey folks! 👋🏻

In case you don't know me, I'm a software craftsperson who has been in the industry for over ten years (time flies!). In that time, I've had the opportunity to work with some wonderful folks and experience some amazing ideas, and even contribute to sharing them with the world through code. It brings me great joy to collaborate with others and learn from them.

If you're looking for a Lead Software Engineer, ideally for a frontend role with an emphasis on web accessibility, please get in touch! I'm ready for the next stage of my journey, and to greet everyone I'll find along the way.
